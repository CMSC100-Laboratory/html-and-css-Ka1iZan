<p> <b> Steps on how to create Github pages:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li> Create your github repository with the name <i> username.github.io </i>, where <i> username </i> is your GitHub username.</li>
  <li> Add a file named index.html into your newly-created repository. The html file can be directly created by clicking the create new file link.</li>
  <li> Commit all the changes necessary to the HTML file (CSS included if used). </li>
  <li> Access live changes of the website via <i> https://username.github.io </i> </li>
</ol>
<p> <b> Key takeaways</b>: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Deploying is made easier (and free) through github pages. This can be helpful especially for side-projects </li>
  <li> CSS complements HTML, but the former can be prone to spaghetti code especially with poor code organization</li>
  <li> While exploring, there are other frameworks that are way convenient than CSS; however, CSS gives more a sense of liberty to the developer as you work with elements by scratch</li>
</ul>
